Minimalistic Hello World: An Introduction
=========================================

Before getting caught up in all the details of higher-level bare metal programming (e.g., the `StdPeriph_Driver`, `CMSIS`, advanced/convoluted `Makefile`s and linker scripts), I find it useful to spend some time doing some bare bare metal programming to see what higher level tools and libraries are doing for you.

## Getting Started ##

Make sure you have already setup your development environment as outlined in [the wiki](https://github.com/plusk01/stm32-playground/wiki/Setting-Up-Your-Development-Environment). You also need to [make sure](https://github.com/plusk01/stm32-playground/wiki/Connecting-to-Hardware) that your computer can properly see your board and debugger.

Once your environment is setup, run `make` to build `main.c`.
